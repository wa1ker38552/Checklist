# Checklist
*Minimalistic todo/checklist app*

Made as a birthday gift (hence the birthday references)

Simple checklist app with Flask backend. *Almost* everything rendered by JS (todo items, different pages). Meant to be hosted on Replit because of the database and free Flask hosting. If you wan't to host somewhere else, you would need to replace the Replit database references with another database or just use JSON files. All the data is stored in JSON. Just a small JS beginner project with a little Python to help out.
